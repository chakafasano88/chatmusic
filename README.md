# Ensemble

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* App overview

  Want to play music with a friend or need to record a riff for a producer but you can't travel?  Ensemble allows you to register, login, plug-in your instrument, and make an audio video call to another user within seconds!

* Inspiration for creating Ensemble

  I am a passionate musician, and have lived the lifestyle of running around NYC from session to session. I thought it a great idea to create an app where-in musicians could plug-in to an audio interface, and have the same high quality experience recording as if they were in the studio! Often times, producers need small revisions on lines, and for someone to travel far an wide for 30 minutes of recording is in-efficient.

* Ruby version

  Ruby 2.4.0

* System dependencies

  For this project I used the following languages:
  HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, JSON,
  Kandy IO API(Kandy's SDK allows the developer to easily implement live audio and video capabilities into his/her app).

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions
